This folders contains scripts for setting up a set of test nodes for [Myel](https://myel.network). These nodes query the Myel network for content at regular intervals.

Assumes you have the `aws cli`, `docker`, and the `pop` library set up appropriately.

## Using these scripts

The scripts for deploying the cluster are in order:
- `01_build_pop.sh`
- `02_deploy.sh`
- `03_delete.sh`

`01_build_pop.sh` builds the test pop image and pushes it to a docker registry.

`02_deploy.sh` deploys a docker image to a series of aws EC2 instances with specifications detailed in `install-playbook/cluster-env.sh`.

`delete_kops.sh` destroys all aws resources associated with the cluster.

## Notes


- Requires the creation of a `test-files` folder containing newline delimited files `cids` and `providers`. The first contains a list of test CIDs to retrieve from providers, the second contains a provider DNS and peer ID on each line -- these are the tested providers.
