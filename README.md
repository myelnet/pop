> Run a lightweight point-of-presence within the [Myel](https://www.myel.network/) network, the community powered content delivery network.


## Technical Highlights

- Uses an IPFS exchange interface like [Bitswap](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/bitswap/).
<!-- - Use IPFS while providing content for retrievals on Filecoin (YES, that means you will earn FIL when we launch on mainnet!) -->
- New content to cache is dispatched via [Gossipsub](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/tree/master/pubsub/gossipsub) and stored by points-of-presence on the network.
- Payments to retrieve content are made via [Filecoin payment channels](https://spec.filecoin.io/systems/filecoin_token/payment_channels/).  
<!-- - Simple API abstracting away Filecoin deal operations -->
<!-- - Upload and retrieve directly from a Filecoin storage miner if no secondary providers cache the content (Coming Soon) -->

## Background

Our mission is to build a community powered content delivery network that is resilient ü¶æ, scalable üåè, and peer-to-peer ‚ÜîÔ∏è to suit the long-term needs of Web3 applications.

We're currently using [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) building blocks and are aspiring to make this library as interoperable as possible with existing Web3 backends such as IPFS.

This library is still experimental so feel free to open an issue if you have any suggestion or would like to contribute!

## Install

As a CLI:

#### Install dependencies:
Since CGO is required, you will need GCC

#### Mac
```commandline
$ brew install gcc make
```

#### Linux
```commandline
$ sudo apt install gcc make
```

Clone the repo.

run:
```commandline
$ make all
```

As a library:

```commandline
$ go get github.com/myelnet/pop
```

## CLI Usage

Run any command with `-h` flag for more details.

```
USAGE
  pop subcommand [flags]

This CLI is still under active development. Commands and flags will
change until a first stable release. To get started run 'pop start'.

SUBCOMMANDS
  start   Starts a POP daemon
  off     Gracefully shuts down the Pop daemon
  ping    Ping the local daemon or a given peer
  put     Put a file into an exchange transaction for storage
  status  Print the state of any ongoing transaction
  commit  Commit a DAG transaction
  get     Retrieve content from the network
  list    List all content indexed in this pop
  wallet  Manage your wallet

FLAGS
  -log info  Set logging mode
```

### Metrics Collection

`pop` nodes can push statistics measuring the performance of retrievals to an
[InfluxDB v2](https://www.influxdata.com/) database if certain
environment variables are set.
Set these variables as follows:

```bash
export INFLUXDB_URL=<INSERT InfluxDB ENDPOINT>
export INFLUXDB_TOKEN=<INSERT TOKEN>
export INFLUXDB_ORG=<INSERT ORG>
export INFLUXDB_BUCKET=<INSERT BUCKET>
```

## Deployment

You can deploy a cluster of nodes on AWS using kubernetes, as detailed in `build/k8s`.

## Library Usage

See [go docs](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/myelnet/pop/exchange).
